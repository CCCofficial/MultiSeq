\title{ MULTIseq.preProcess_allCells }

\description{ 'MULTIseq.preProcess_allCells' reads in raw MULTI-seq sample barcode FASTQs and allocates reads into cell barcode, UMI, and sample barcode subsets. \cr

R1 reads must exactly match cell IDs provided in whitelist. Specifies cell barcode from R1 reads 1-16, UMI from R1 reads 17-26/28 (V2/V3 chemistry), and sample barcode from R2 reads 1-8. \cr

This function is a analogous to 'MULTIseq.preProcess', but is better suited for large cell ID vectors (i.e., ~10^6 total barcodes).
}

\usage{ MULTIseq.preProcess_allCells(R1, R2, whitelist, chemistry="V3") }

\arguments{
  \item{R1} { Read 1 raw FASTQ file path }
  \item{R2} { Read 2 raw FASTQ file path }
  \item{whitelist} { Cell ID whitelist used to parse R1 FASTQ file  }
  \item{chemistry} { 10X reagent chemistry, determines UMI sequence position. Set to either "V2" or "V3" }
}

\details{ Requires 'ShortRead' R package. }

\value{ An nRead x 3 dataframe with columns correpsonding to (1) cell barcode, (2) UMI, and (3) MULTI-seq sample barcode sequences. }
